# 'Singular person in call' checker (needs a new name)

This code was created by me for a world-record discord call attempt, to alert us if only one person was in the call.

**WARNING**
This code is extremely shit. Do not download it unless you are fucking retarded.


**HOW TO USE**
Basically just run the code, open up a discord call in firefox (make sure the orange banner is up the top and you have not joined the call) and let the code do it's work.

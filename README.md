# 'Singular person in call' checker

This code was created by me for a world-record discord call attempt, to alert us if only one person was in the call.

**WARNING**
This code is extremely shit. Do not download it unless you are fucking retarded.

**HOW TO USE**
Open a browser with a discord call open, start the program and then quickly fullscreen the discord tab.

# 'Singular person in call' checker (needs a new name)

This code was created by me for a world-record discord call attempt, to alert us if only one person was in the call.

WARNING
This code is extremely shit. Do not download it unless you are fucking retarded.

Basically just run the code, open up a discord call in a web browser and let the code do it's work.
